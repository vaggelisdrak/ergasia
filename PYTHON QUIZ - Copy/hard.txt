The duplicates from the list get removed, due to the python dictionary,which doesn't allow them

What will the code return?
<pre>
mylist = ['a','b','a','c','c']
mylist = list(dict.fromkeys(mylist))
print(mylist)
</pre>

1. ['a','b','c'] ***
2. ['a','b','a','c','c']
3. [a,b,c]
4. ['a','b','c','c']

Q42. 
hard
In Python, AND operator has higher precedence than OR operator. 
So, it is evaluated first. i.e, (b and c) evaluates to false.
Now OR operator is evaluated. Here, (True or False) evaluates to True. 
So the if condition becomes True and GEEKSFORGEEKS is printed as output.

What will the code return?
<pre>
a = True
b = False
c = False
  
if a or b and c:
    print ("GEEKSFORGEEKS")
else:
    print ("geeksforgeeks")
</pre>

1. geeksforgeeks
2. GEEKSFORGEEKS ***
3. error
4. GEEKSFORGEEKSgeeksforgeeks
